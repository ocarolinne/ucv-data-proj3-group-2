# Air Pollution: California's Journey In Air Quality
---

## Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is a global public health problem. Air pollution has a great impact on the environment, the health of people and also the economy. With the datasets collected, we obtained air quality data from all over the world and decided to focus on the US, specifically California. Through the datasets of Water and Air Quality, the Census and US Pollution - our focus is to educate and aware the public on what pollutants contribute to air pollution and the decline over the years using California's history/journey.


## Project Overview
The project focuses on the general air quality of the United States, the focus on California and the gasses that affect cities across the state, and lastly the analysis of California's trend over the years with the impact of California's Reduction Plan. In this repository we have included: 

- waterAir_quality.ipynb File: Shares the codes created to filter/clean our datasets, along with merging the three datasets collected. This has allowed our group to create the visuals and to give us information on trends over the years and the concentration of gasses in the state of California.
- CSVs: Of the original data and ones created
- Air Quality Schema and Pictures of Tables/ERD: Created using PostGres 
- USA Visual Json File : Code created by the CSV created through the IPYNB file
- California Dashboard JSON File: Code created by the CSV created through the IPYNB file
- California's Air Quality Improvement Over Time visual
- Air Pollution: California's Journey in Air Quality
  


## Conclusion
With the research and the work done in creating this project, we have concluded that California has a great model in improving the air quality by reducing gases. The United States is part of the Global Public Health problem of air pollution. (need to finish)
